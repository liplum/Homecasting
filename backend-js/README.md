# JavaScript Backend

## Getting Started

Run `npm start` to compile and start the server.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

When you first start the server, an error will be thrown,
which will prompt you to configure it.

A file named `meditree.json` will then be generated in the current working directory.
From there, you can move this file up the file tree until you reach the root "/" directory.
